Now that we've went through a few exercises, we're ready to take on the project!

For our class project, we will be given a list of dictionaries that includes car models, their year, and their price.

First: we wanna sort this list of dictionaries based on the cars price:

This is the dictionary we gonna be working with:

cars = [
{'car': 'Mitsubishi', 'year': 2004, 'price': 12000},
{'car': 'Ford', 'year': 2002, 'price': 14000},
{'car': 'BMW', 'year': 2017, 'price': 45000},
{'car': 'Mercedes', 'year': 2008, 'price': 18000},
{'car': 'Audi', 'year': 2005, 'price': 16000},
{'car': 'VW', 'year': 2012, 'price': 32000},
{'car': 'Toyota', 'year': 2011, 'price': 36000},
{'car': 'Toyota', 'year': 2011, 'price': 36000},
{'car': 'Maserati', 'year': 2020, 'price': 65000},
{'car': 'Porsche', 'year': 2021, 'price': 120000},
{'car': 'Hyundai', 'year': 2022, 'price': 45000},
]

we will store the newly sorted listed (based on price) in a list called: price_sorted

Then, we will do the same but instead we will sort the list based on the year, and store it in a new list called: year_sorted

both lists will be sorted from lower to higher.

optionally, we could create a simple User Interface for our user to choose how they wanna sort their list:


If the user chooses 'a', it will call the sort function based on price, then print the newly sorted list for the user to see.


notice the program is looping since it's in a while loop, until the user chooses 'e' to exist the program and break the loop.

If the user chooses 'b', it will call the sort function based on year, then print the newly sorted list for the user to see.


If the user enters anything besides 'a', 'b' or 'e' we will print a message that says "Invalid Input"


finally, if the user chooses 'e' the program will break the while loop then exist.


I will include the solution to the project.
